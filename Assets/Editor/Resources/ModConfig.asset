  author: VFlyer
  description: "[i]Now it's more unfair because you removed You Watanabe from Best
    Girl.[/i]\n\nThis mod contains 2 modules: \n- Unfair's Revenge (as if the module
    was more in-line to the original mod idea)\n- Unfair's Cruel Revenge (as if the
    idea of the other module was considered too easy to disarm, and allowed the implementer
    to expand the normal decrypting methods)\nContains a snippet of TheFatRat - The
    Calling, You only can hear this on Unfair's Cruel Revenge and if that is solved
    very last. The full track can be found [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KR-eV7fHNbM]here.[/url]\n\nOriginal
    idea by Tachatat18\nImplemented by VFlyer\n\nSource Code: https://github.com/VFlyer/UnfairsRevenge\nTemporary
    Manuals can be found in source code, as PDFs\n"
